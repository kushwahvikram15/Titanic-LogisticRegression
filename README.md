#Logistic Regression on Titanic Dataset
In this project I'm attempting to do data analysis on the Titanic Dataset. In the first step I'm doing a very quick data exploration and preprocessing on a visual level, plotting some simple plots to understand the data better. Then I've done some data cleaning and built a Classifier that can predict whether a passenger survived or not.
